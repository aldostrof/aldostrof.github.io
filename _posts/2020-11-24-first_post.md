**Hello, world!**

Because *every* project starts with those two words, don't you agree?  
In the recent past I've been trying to find something to work on, at my own pace, after work-time and in my spare time.  
After all the programming ideas born and never raised, I thought about blogging.  
I was like *why not?*  
But how could I make this more interesting?  


And that's how [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) came to my mind.  
I loved the idea of the interconnection between GitHub and blogging, plus I was already trying to set Markdown as my own standard when writing documentation.  
So, blogging in Markdown? *Now you've got my attention.*

So I found this nice template, [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/) that is very customizable and nice looking: opened my Visual Studio Code, tweaked some parameters, added some magic and *voil√†*, here we are!  


I know what you're thinking: *but what is this blog about?*  
Well, that's easy: here I will collect posts about my interests, such as programming ideas, tech-interests that I'd like to share and so on (read the [About](https://aldostrof.github.io/about/) section if you want to know more).  

Are you ready to begin the journey?  
Don't worry, it's on me!
